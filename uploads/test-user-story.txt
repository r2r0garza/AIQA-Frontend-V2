# Login Feature

As a user, I want to be able to log in to the application using my email and password so that I can access my account and use the application's features.

## Background
The application needs a secure login system to protect user data and provide personalized experiences.

## Requirements
- Users should be able to enter their email and password
- The system should validate the credentials against the database
- If valid, users should be redirected to their dashboard
- If invalid, users should see an appropriate error message
- The login page should have a "Remember me" option
- There should be a "Forgot password" link

## Additional Notes
- The login form should be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Password field should mask the input
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication in the future
